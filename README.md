# 📚 LogicShelf - Intelligent Library Management System

**LogicShelf** is a specialized Python-based tool designed to manage personal book collections and track future reading goals through structured data workflows. This project demonstrates the application of core programming concepts to solve real-world organization challenges.

## 🎯 Overview
The system follows a rigorous logical path, starting from initial data entry to dynamic list updates and record maintenance. It distinguishes between books currently owned and those intended for future acquisition, ensuring a clear overview of the user's literary assets.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Dual-Category Management:** Utilizes independent data structures (Lists) for existing library items and future wishlists.
* **Automated Acquisition Logic:** Features a seamless transition phase where items are moved from the wishlist to the library upon acquisition.
* **Data Integrity & Cleansing:** Includes a donation module to update the library records accurately and handle data removal safely.
* **Interactive UI Logic:** Implements user-friendly prompts with conditional checks to manage inputs and skip optional steps without errors.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Core Concepts:** List Manipulation, Conditional Logic, User Input Validation.
* **Design Pattern:** Logic-Driven Development (LDD) based on pre-coded flowcharts.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `laybrary books.py`: The main source code containing the library management logic.
- `Flowchart`: Visual representation of the system's decision-making process.

## 📈 Roadmap
- [ ] Integration with SQLite for persistent data storage.
- [ ] Implementation of a search algorithm for large collections.
- [ ] Development of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
